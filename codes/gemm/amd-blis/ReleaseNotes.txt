AMD BLIS - Release Notes - version 3.0
--------------------------------------------

BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance 
BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed to isolate 
essential kernels of computation that, when optimized, enable optimized 
implementations of most of its commonly used and computationally intensive 
operations. Some of these essential kernels have been optimized for the AMD 
EPYC processor family by AMD and others. The optimizations are done for single 
and double precision routines.  

Highlights of AMD BLIS 3.0
---------------------------
- Added support for AMD's zen3 architecture, build can auto detect if it is 
  running on zen3 and enable features and optimizations specific to zen3 architecture

- Added support for following copy transposition routines

    ?imatcopy:    Performs scaling and in-place transposition/copying matrices
    ?omatcopy:    Performs scaling and out-place transposition/copying matrices
    ?omatcopy2:   Performs two-strided scaling and out-of-place transposition/copying matrices 
    ?omatadd:     Scales and sums two matrices including in addition to out-of-place transposition

- Added support for following BLAS extension API's

    cblas_?cabs1
    cblas_i?amin
    cblas_?axpby
    cblas_?gemm_batch
    cblas_?gemm3m

- Debug trace and input logging support added for following APIs

    amax, asum, axpby, axpy, copy, dot, gemm, gemm3m, gemmt, gemv
    ger, hemm, hemv, her, her2, her2k, herk, imatcopy, nrm2, omatadd
    omatcopy, omatcopy2, scal, swap, symm, symv, syr, syr2, syr2k, syrk
    trmm, trmv, trsm, trsv

- Added Performance optimizations of ?dotv, ?gemv, ?axpyv for complex and double complex datatypes.


AMD Optimized BLIS libraries are validated on a variety of platforms:

-   Ubuntu 20.04, openMP-4.5, glibc 2.31, with both GCC-9.3.0 and AOCC-3.0
-   Centos 8, openMP-4.5, glibc 2.28, with both GCC-9.2.0 and AOCC-3.0
-   Sles 15, openMP-4.5, glibc 2.28, with both GCC-9.2.0 and AOCC-3.0
-   RHEL 8.2, openMP-4.5, glibc 2.28, with both GCC-8.3.1 and AOCC-3.0

The package contains BLIS Library binaries which includes optimizations for 
the AMD EPYC processor family, header files and examples.
